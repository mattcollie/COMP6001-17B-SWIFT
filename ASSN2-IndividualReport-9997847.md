# Comp6002 Assessment Individual Report
## Ashton Lye

### Week 1
In the first week we discussed ideas for what apps we could create for the assessment. We originally had a few ideas to do with location tracking and automatically registering student attendance, but this required us to use a raspberry pi in addition to our app and we realised that it wouldn't really make use of a web API - which was kind of the point of the whole assessment. Instead we looked at using some kind of service to be able to check room timetables, but I instead suggested that we make an app that allows us to check our own class timetables as I felt I would use that a lot more. We also wanted to use the phones camera to scan our ID cards rather than just manually inputting the student's ID number, as we thought that was kind of boring. We would make use of an API in this app by storing the data online and requesting it in the app, in order to meet the requirements of the assessment.

### Week 2
In the second week we have gotten together to refine and improve the app idea we had - I suggested that we make it possible for students to update or add new items to their timetables in the app. The rest of the team thought this was a good idea so we added it to the list and started assigning roles to everyone. I was given the task to read up on ARKit and learn how we could use it to scan the barcodes on the cards. In my research I discovered that ARKit wasn't actually the right tool for the job - it turns out that iOS and swift have the AVCapture framework built in to detect and scan both QR codes and regular barcodes. Since I'm in charge of making that part of the app, I will use the AVCapture framework in the app to scan the barcodes and then use the data to request the student's timetable, which Matt is in charge of working on.
